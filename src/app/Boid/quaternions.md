Here is a step-by-step process to convert a quaternion to an axis-angle representation and then to a rotation matrix:
* Normalize the quaternion: Ensure that the quaternion is a unit quaternion, i.e., its length is equal to 1. If it is not already a unit quaternion, divide each component of the quaternion by its length.
* Calculate the angle: Calculate the angle of rotation in radians as twice the arccosine of the w component of the quaternion. In other words, angle = 2 * arccos(w).
* Calculate the axis: Calculate the axis of rotation by dividing the x, y, and z components of the quaternion by the sine of half the angle. In other words, axis = (x/sin(angle/2), y/sin(angle/2), z/sin(angle/2)).
* Construct the rotation matrix: Construct the rotation matrix using the axis and angle. To do this, we first calculate the cross product matrix of the axis, which is a 3x3 matrix that can be obtained by arranging the cross products of the axis components in a specific way. We then use this matrix and the angle to construct the rotation matrix as follows:

```
crossProductMatrix = [[ 0, -axis_z, axis_y],
[ axis_z, 0, -axis_x],
[-axis_y, axis_x, 0   ]]

rotationMatrix = cos(angle)*IdentityMatrix + sin(angle)*crossProductMatrix + (1-cos(angle))*axis*axis_transpose
```

where IdentityMatrix is the 3x3 identity matrix, and axis_transpose is the transpose of the axis vector.

Once you have the rotation matrix, you can use it to transform vertices or other data in your game engine.

In summary, we can convert quaternions to axis-angle matrices by first computing the angle and axis of rotation from the quaternion, and then using them to construct the rotation matrix.
